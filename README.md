# Saber Accounting MVP

## Version 2.9.46 (Windows build: every program file included automatically)

- The 2.9.45 build failed only because GitHub still had the 2.9.43 workflow (uploading files does not replace the `.github` folder), so the new payroll modules were missing from the build and the safety test stopped it.
- The build step now adds every program module of the repository by itself (all `*.py` except tests), so new files never need a workflow edit again. The list is printed in the build log. The safety test accepts this.
- Replace `.github/workflows/build-windows-installer.yml` on GitHub once more (Edit, paste, Commit); after that, uploading the ZIP is enough.
- Changed files: .github/workflows/build-windows-installer.yml, test_v2_9_42.py, installer.iss, app_runtime.py, README.md.

## Version 2.9.45 (negative stock alert, returns vs notes, brand, project / branch, report check-up)

- **Negative stock: alert and continue.** When a sale, stock issue, transfer or cancellation would take an item below zero in a warehouse, Saber now shows the item, warehouse, date, quantity available and requested, and asks "Save anyway?". Yes saves it (the documents concerned are marked, so later work is not blocked); No saves nothing. Average and FIFO costing both handle negative stock: the missing quantity goes out at the last known cost and the next receipt in that warehouse settles it. Works from every screen (the data service asks through the X-Allow-Negative-Stock confirmation).
- **Return vs Credit Note vs Debit Note.** A **Return** (Return Selected Invoice) brings goods back / sends them back and moves stock. A **Credit Note** or **Debit Note** is a discount or price adjustment: it never moves stock, even when its lines name items. New column `invoices.is_return`; returns made earlier are recognised automatically. Lists show Sales / Purchase Return, Credit Note, Debit Note; the PDF title is RETURN NOTE for returns.
- **Brand** on items (Items screen, list column, combobox of existing brands), report filter, and the new report **Stock by Brand & Warehouse**.
- **Project and branch on stock documents** (Stock Documents screen) and **Brand / Project / Branch filters** on the inventory reports (movements and sales margin also filter by the document's project / branch).
- **Choose what appears**: Warehouses & Settings > "Show in the inventory screens": Brand, Warehouse, Project, Branch. Unticked ones disappear from items, stock documents and report filters.
- **Report check-up (all reports, screen, PDF and Excel):** columns that are empty or zero on every line are left out (code and name always stay; official layouts keep every column); zero amounts show as "-"; amounts are right-aligned in PDF; total lines are bold. The R10 worksheet now fits on one page width. The official payroll statements show English and Arabic in separate columns with clean header lines.
- Fixed: the 2.9.41 error handler no longer shows a message when the session has expired (the sign-in screen is shown, as before 2.9.41).
- Note found during the check-up: `Assets/Saber_for_Audit_logo.png` is not a valid PNG image (the program falls back to the text logo). Replace it with the real logo file.
- Tests: new `test_inventory_v2_9_45.py` (shortage asks then saves when confirmed; sale invoice alert with nothing half-saved; FIFO negative stock settles on the next receipt; the real client asks and resends; return moves stock but credit / debit notes do not; brand filter and report; project / branch on documents and in movements; screen settings; tidy reports). Two tests of goods coming back on a credit note now mark it as a return. 422 tests pass.
- Changed files: inventory.py, database.py, server.py, client.py, report_export.py, payroll_official.py, desktop.py, desktop_inventory.py, desktop_invoices.py, desktop_final.py, app_runtime.py, installer.iss, Assets/user_guide.html, README.md, test_inventory_v2_9_45.py (new), test_final_features.py, test_payroll_declaration.py.

## Version 2.9.44 (payroll like the official salary declaration workbooks)

Built on the layout of the MOF salary declaration workbooks (employees register, monthly & cumulative movement, R10, R5, R6, audit statement, leavers register). The NSSF statements, NSSF format and NSSF payments are unchanged (owner request).

- **Allowances by R6 line** (`payroll_lines.py`): cost of living and extra indemnity (100), representation taxable / not (110), car (160), housing (170), food (180), clothing (190), cash handling (200), health insurance (210), education (220), marriage (230), birth (240), sickness (250), death (260), other (300). Most exist twice (taxable / not taxable): the amount is entered in the right one, as in the paper workbook. Taxable recurring allowances are taxed with the salary; grants (220-300) are taxed like a bonus. Taxable allowances are subject to NSSF unless listed in the setting `payroll_allowances_not_nssf`; not-taxable ones are not. Saved with each payroll (`payroll_records.allowances`) and posted to the Allowances account (empty = salary account). The cumulative tax method counts earlier months' taxable allowances.
- **Employee register** (employee window, new box): unit code / unit, cost of living, extra indemnity, representation (taxable / not) per month, "not subject to NSSF" for end of service / family allowances / sickness & maternity (used by the calculation), structured address, second phone, leaving reason. Saving without these fields keeps them.
- **Monthly Payroll Sheet | الحركة الشهرية** (Payroll Entry): every employee working in the month in one table (saved payroll, or the register amounts for a new month). Calculate All, Save All (draft), Post All, Export Excel. Posted rows are locked; one employee's error does not stop the others.
- **New statements** (Payroll Reports): R5_BOXES and R10_BOXES (boxes 70-90, 100-190 for (1) board / managers and (2) employees, 240-270, and tax withheld per quarter for the payments box), R6_LINES (lines 100-300 x total / not taxable / taxable, then 310, 330, 340, 350, 360), AUDIT (sum of all R6 against R5, each check OK or CHECK), MOVEMENT (month and year-to-date per employee), REGISTER and LEAVERS. Box 100 = R6 lines 100-150, box 110 = lines 160-300, 130 / 140 / 150 = not-taxable transport / representation / other; 170 = 160 - 180.
- Not included: the electronic DAS file for the MOF portal (its file specification is needed) and lump-sum workers (boxes 90 / 240 / 250 show 0).
- Database: STARTUP_SCHEMA_VERSION 4 (new employee columns and payroll_records.allowances, added on opening; existing data unchanged).
- Tests: new `test_payroll_declaration.py` (16 tests: allowances taxed / exempt / one-off / not NSSF, register NSSF flags, bad amounts refused, save + post balanced, cumulative tax, register fields kept, R6 lines, R5 boxes add up, R10 = R5 for one quarter, audit reconciles, movement YTD, registers, sheet rows and payloads, the sheet window calculates / saves / posts). 413 tests pass.
- Changed files: payroll_lines.py, payroll_official.py, desktop_payroll_sheet.py (new), database.py, payroll_reports.py, desktop.py, desktop_payroll.py, desktop_final.py, app_runtime.py, installer.iss, .github/workflows/build-windows-installer.yml, Assets/user_guide.html, README.md, test_payroll_declaration.py (new).

## Version 2.9.43 (every journal entry must balance)

- **No journal entry can be saved with total Debit different from total Credit**, whatever writes it: invoices, expenses, payments, payroll, depreciation, inventory, imports, year-end, journal vouchers. The rule sits in the database layer: every connection notes (TEMP triggers on journal_lines) each entry whose lines are added, changed or deleted, and just before the change is saved the whole entry is checked. If any entry is off by more than 0.01, nothing of the change is saved and the message names the entry, both totals and the difference (also written to the log). Changing both sides in one save is allowed; removing a whole entry is allowed.
- Entries written by older versions are not touched and never block an upgrade (the check is paused only while the program repairs old data on opening). **General Journal > "Check Balance"** lists any entry that was saved unbalanced before 2.9.43, with the difference, so it can be corrected with a Journal Voucher.
- Note: the rule covers everything the program writes. Copying files with outside tools (SQLite programs) is not covered.
- User guide updated (English and Arabic).
- Tests: new `test_balance_guard.py` (balanced saved; unbalanced and one-sided refused with nothing saved; a saved entry cannot be unbalanced by changing or deleting a line; both sides changed together allowed; whole entry deleted allowed; 0.01 rounding accepted; old unbalanced entries listed and never block an upgrade; a refusal does not block the next save). The year-end test that sets up an old one-sided closing now writes it the way an older version did. 397 tests pass.
- Changed files: database.py, server.py, client.py, desktop_reports.py, app_runtime.py, installer.iss, Assets/user_guide.html, README.md, test_balance_guard.py (new), test_final_features.py.

## Version 2.9.42 (every backup checked, update check, user guide, screens split further)

- **Every backup is checked as soon as it is made** (automatic, manual and safety copies): it is opened, SQLite's integrity check runs, and it must have the same tables as the original. Backup & Restore has a new **Checked** column (ok / FAILED / not checked for copies made before 2.9.42). A copy that fails is set aside as `.damaged` (never listed, restored or counted in the 30 automatic copies), the error is shown and logged, and an automatic backup is tried again next time. A lock, unlock or restore stops if its safety copy cannot be verified.
- **Update check:** the installed program looks once a day (in the background, never blocking) for the newest GitHub Release of Nancy81188/Final-Version. When a newer version exists a gold **"New version … available"** button appears at the top; it opens the download page and reminds to back up first. Nothing is downloaded or installed by itself. Offline or a private repository: no message, a line in the log. Another address can be written in `SaberAccounting\update_url.txt` (a GitHub release address or a JSON file `{"version": "...", "url": "..."}`), or `off`.
- **Releases:** "Run workflow" on main now also publishes a GitHub Release `vX.Y.Z` with the installer and its SHA-256 (pushes and pull requests do not). The workflow needs `contents: write` for this.
- **User guide** in English and Arabic, shipped with the program: **Help / مساعدة** button at the top. Covers start, invoices, PDF import, payroll and official forms, VAT, closing the books, backups, problems and updates.
- **Screens split further, no change in behaviour:** desktop_stage3.py (1,916 lines) -> desktop_stage3.py (import, payments), desktop_purchases.py, desktop_asset_register.py, desktop_expenses.py, desktop_stage3_common.py; desktop_brains.py (1,034) -> desktop_brains.py (journal voucher), desktop_balance_reports.py (trial balance, statement), desktop_brains_common.py.
- **Errors ignored on purpose are now logged** at debug level (20 places). Set the Windows variable `SABER_DEBUG_LOG=1` to write them to saber.log when support needs the details. A failing sign-out screen is now a warning.
- **Installer warning (free):** the installer is not code-signed (a certificate is paid). Windows SmartScreen may show "Windows protected your PC": More info > Run anyway. The SHA-256 published with each Release lets anyone check the file is the original. The user guide explains this.
- Tests: new `test_v2_9_42.py` (backup check ok / damaged / missing tables / older copies, update check newer / same / offline / once a day / address and off, installer and program versions equal, guide shipped, every desktop module in the build, moved screens still in the window). Two tests in test_pdf_ocr.py now patch the PDF reader in its new module. 390 tests pass.
- Changed files: database.py, app_runtime.py, desktop.py, desktop_settings.py, desktop_stage3.py, desktop_brains.py, client.py, company_manager.py, desktop_dimensions.py, desktop_payroll.py, desktop_v22.py, desktop_stage3_common.py, desktop_purchases.py, desktop_asset_register.py, desktop_expenses.py, desktop_brains_common.py, desktop_balance_reports.py (new), Assets/user_guide.html (new), .github/workflows/build-windows-installer.yml, installer.iss, README.md, test_pdf_ocr.py, test_v2_9_42.py (new).

## Version 2.9.41 (safety and upkeep: private data service, one copy open, error log, file rename, screens split)

- **Private data service:** the window and its built-in data service now talk on a **free port chosen by Windows** (no more fixed 8765, so another program using that port can no longer stop Saber from opening) and with a **secret key made at every start**. Any request without the key is refused (403), so no other program on the PC can read or change the data. The key is sent only to that private address, never to a shared server typed in the Server field.
- **One copy open:** starting Saber a second time brings the open window to the front instead of opening a second copy on the same data.
- **Error log:** errors are written with full details to `SaberAccounting\logs\saber.log` (5 files of 1 MB kept). A failed button or screen shows the message and writes the details to the log. New button **Settings > Backup & Restore > "Open Log Folder"**. Errors that were silently ignored are now logged (VAT in LBP not worked out for an invoice, header logo, EUR rate download).
- **Main data file renamed** from `saber_accounting_v0_7.db` to `saber_accounting.db`, once, on the first start of 2.9.41: the file is copied with SQLite's backup, checked (integrity check, same tables), the company list is updated (a copy is kept as `companies.json.before-2.9.41`), and the old file is kept as `saber_accounting_v0_7.db.before-2.9.41`. If anything fails, the old file keeps being used and the reason is in the log. The background backup service follows the new name.
- **desktop.py split by section, no change in behaviour:** `desktop_common.py` (shared helpers), `desktop_invoices.py`, `desktop_parties.py`, `desktop_payroll.py`, `desktop_reports.py`, `desktop_settings.py`. desktop.py goes from 3,600 to about 1,050 lines. All new modules are in the build.
- If the first-time admin password is cancelled, the program now closes quietly instead of crashing.
- Tests: new `test_runtime_v2_9_41.py` (free port, key refused / accepted, key never sent to other servers, one copy only, log file, safe rename incl. interrupted and damaged-file cases, screens still part of the window). 377 tests pass.
- Changed files: app_runtime.py (new), desktop_common.py, desktop_invoices.py, desktop_parties.py, desktop_payroll.py, desktop_reports.py, desktop_settings.py (new, moved from desktop.py), desktop.py, run_desktop.py, server.py, client.py, backup_service.py, database.py, desktop_v22.py, .github/workflows/build-windows-installer.yml, installer.iss, README.md, test_runtime_v2_9_41.py (new).

## Version 2.9.40 (employee sex for the official forms)

- Employee record: new field **Sex (for official forms)** (male / female) in the employee window. It marks ذكر / أنثى on MOF R3 and CNSS 2AA, 41A and the leave notice. Existing employees keep an empty value until it is chosen; saving an employee without the field does not clear it. Arabic values (ذكر / أنثى) are accepted from imports.
- Database: column `employees.sex` added on opening (STARTUP_SCHEMA_VERSION 3).
- Tests: employee sex saved, changed, kept, and marked on the form. 366 tests pass.
- Changed files: database.py, desktop.py, installer.iss, README.md, test_payroll_excel_forms.py.

## Version 2.9.39 (official payroll forms as editable Excel, filled automatically)

- **Payroll > Employees > "Official Forms (Excel)"**: select an employee, choose the form and save. Five forms, laid out like the printed ones (right-to-left, A4, one page per sheet):
  - MOF **R3** - new employee registration; MOF **R3-1** - covering letter (company only, no employee needed);
  - CNSS **2AA** - employment declaration (2 sheets: declaration and family members); CNSS **41A** - employment notice; CNSS **leave notice**.
- Filled from Settings > Company (name, MOF and NSSF numbers, address, phone, e-mail) and the employee record (name / surname, father, mother, birth date and place, nationality, ID, NSSF and MOF numbers, marital status, children, spouse working, hire / leave date, job, salary). Registration numbers go one digit per box, dates into day / month / year, and options are marked with X. Anything Saber does not hold (for example the sex, which is not in the employee record) stays empty for the user; light-yellow cells stay editable.
- New module `payroll_excel_forms.py` (added to the build as a hidden import). Tests: `test_payroll_excel_forms.py` and a window test for the dialog. 365 tests pass.
- Changed files: payroll_excel_forms.py (new), desktop.py, .github/workflows/build-windows-installer.yml, installer.iss, README.md, test_payroll_excel_forms.py (new), test_ui_v2_9_18.py.

## Version 2.9.38 (PDF invoices with unreadable labels; USD invoices showing the VAT in LBP)

- Some PDFs use fonts without a character map: the text layer holds control characters and scrambled Arabic words. Such pages are now read with OCR, and the OCR reading is preferred.
- When the amounts have no readable label (a summary box with numbers only), the reader recognises **before VAT + VAT = total with VAT exactly 11% of before VAT**; dates, percentages and long reference numbers are ignored. The Check note says "recognised without labels by the 11% VAT check - verify".
- A line such as "VAT 11% LBP 374,110,000" on a foreign-currency invoice is the VAT in LBP: it is no longer taken as the VAT amount, and the invoice currency is set to USD (EUR when the invoice mentions EUR / €), with the implied rate shown in the Check note.
- A date is never taken as the invoice number.
- Checked on invoice 5000290336 (Mohamad M. Saad): number 16, date 01-11-2024, supplier, USD, 38,000 / 4,180 / 42,180 - 7 / 7 fields. Tests added with the real text and OCR kept in `tests_data/`. 361 tests pass.
- Changed files: pdf_import.py, test_pdf_real_scans.py, tests_data/ (2 new files), installer.iss, desktop.py, README.md.

## Version 2.9.37 (scanned PDF import fixed on Windows)

- **Cause of empty rows for scanned PDFs in the installed program:** the bundled OCR language files were passed to Tesseract as `--tessdata-dir "C:\Program Files\...\tessdata"`. pytesseract splits that text in a way that breaks Windows paths (backslashes, spaces, quotes), so Tesseract found no language and every scanned PDF showed "scanned image (no text inside)". The folder is now given through `TESSDATA_PREFIX`, which needs no splitting.
- Better reading of real scans (checked on a Tabet Entreprises variation order: 7 / 7 fields right):
  - **Date:** a date on a line labelled "Date" wins over dates in the item table; when the full-page OCR misses an underlined or right-aligned date / reference, the top of the page is read again (left and right halves separately).
  - **Before VAT:** when there are several section totals, the total line whose amount + VAT = Grand Total is used (e.g. "TOTAL A+B+C").
  - **Supplier:** junk read from a logo before the company name is removed.
- **Import preview:** selecting a row shows its full **Check** note under the buttons (the column is too narrow for long notes).
- Tests: `test_pdf_real_scans.py` with the real OCR text kept in `tests_data/`. 360 tests pass.
- Changed files: pdf_import.py, desktop_stage3.py, installer.iss, desktop.py, README.md, test_pdf_real_scans.py (new), tests_data/ocr_tabet_variation_order.txt (new).

## Version 2.9.36 (automatic backups and closing the books)

- **Automatic backups, on by default:** every time a company / year is opened, a backup is made in the background if the last one is older than the backup interval (24 hours by default). The installer task "Start automatic daily backups with Windows" is now ticked by default. Only the newest **30 automatic** copies are kept; manual ("Create Backup Now") and safety copies are never deleted. Backup & Restore shows the type "automatic".
- **Close the books (period lock):** Settings > Backup & Restore > "Close the books" (administrator). Enter the last date to lock (for example 31-03-2026 after filing Q1) and press Lock: no invoice, expense, payment, payroll, depreciation or journal entry dated on or before that date can be added, changed or deleted, from any screen or import. The rule is enforced by database triggers, so no path can bypass it. Unlock reopens all periods. A safety backup is made before every lock / unlock, and both are written to the audit log. Program upgrades pause the lock only while they repair old entries, then restore it.
- AI_RULES.md updated with both rules (owner decision).
- Tests: new `test_books_lock_backups.py` (lock refuses insert / change / delete of entries and lines on or before the date, nothing is half-posted, unlock works, the lock survives reopening; automatic backup once per interval, 30 kept, manual copies kept; restore brings the data back) and a window test for Lock / Unlock. 357 tests pass.
- Changed files: database.py (STARTUP_SCHEMA_VERSION 2), server.py, client.py, desktop.py, installer.iss, AI_RULES.md, README.md, test_books_lock_backups.py (new), test_ui_v2_9_18.py.

## Version 2.9.35 (Windows build: UTF-8 test output)

- On the Windows runner the console is cp1252: when a test failed with an Arabic or special character in its message, printing the GitHub annotation crashed the whole test run (UnicodeEncodeError). The annotation print is now encoding-safe and the Windows workflow runs Python in UTF-8 mode (`PYTHONUTF8=1`, `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8`).
- Changed files: test_000_ci_annotations.py, .github/workflows/build-windows-installer.yml, installer.iss, desktop.py (title), README.md.

## Version 2.9.34 (build fix)

- `requirements.txt` listed `pypdfium2`, `pytesseract` and `PyMuPDF` twice with different versions (left over from the 2.9.32 merge), so `pip install` stopped and both GitHub workflows failed. It now has one line per package, the same versions as the last green build (2.9.31). No code change.
- Changed files: requirements.txt, installer.iss, desktop.py (title), README.md.

## Version 2.9.33 (clear NSSF table; simpler Assets & Depreciation)

- **Payroll > Official Reports > "NSSF - Contributions table (all employees)"**: the first table now has **one line per employee** for the chosen period (Monthly, Quarterly or Yearly): number of months, salary subject, sickness base, employee 3%, employer 8%, family base and 6%, end-of-service base and 8.5%, total, allowances paid and net due, with a TOTAL line. Each month is calculated with the ceilings and rates in force that month, so a quarter or a year that crosses a change (for example 08-2025: sickness ceiling 120,000,000, minimum wage 28,000,000) is right without any manual split.
- Below it: the payment summary by branch, then **"Rules applied in this period"** (one line per group of months with the same ceilings and rates), then the monthly detail for checking, then the employee list. Column titles are shorter so the table fits on screen. Quarterly is the default period (Auto is still available).
- The CNSS forms and the annual settlement read the monthly detail (`monthly_detail` in the report) as before, so their figures do not change.
- **Purchases & Expenses > Assets & Depreciation**, tab **2. Asset Data Entry** is simplified: choose the asset account (from tab 1, it fills the rate, life and accounts), one "Asset" box (code, description, currency, purchase date, value, residual, start date, invoice), one "Depreciation" box, the buttons Save / New / Delete, and the asset register. The schedule of one asset opens with "Schedule of this asset"; **Annual Rollforward** moved to tab 3 next to the monthly posting.
- Tests: new test for the NSSF table (one line per employee = sum of its months, rules grouped by month, monthly / quarterly / yearly) and a window test for the three asset tabs; two NSSF tests now read the monthly detail / employee list by name instead of by position. 352 tests pass.
- Changed files: payroll_reports.py, cnss_forms.py, desktop_final.py, desktop_stage3.py, desktop_assets.py, desktop.py, installer.iss, README.md, test_final_features.py, test_employee_r3.py, test_ui_v2_9_18.py.

## Version 2.9.32 (the two lines of development merged - nothing lost)

- After version 2.9.23 the project split in two: the Replit line (2.9.24-2.9.27: VAT filing worksheet, invoice returns, warehouse transfer screen, statement navigation, account lookup create, asset attachments, CNSS forms, PDF form editor, party similarity, OCR review) and the ChatGPT line (2.9.24-2.9.31: payroll tax forms, faster tabs, payroll periods, lighter startup, PDF reading, assets depreciation, OCR in the installer). When 2.9.30 was uploaded the Replit line was lost from GitHub.
- 2.9.32 is a 3-way merge of both lines on their common base 2.9.23. Every feature and every test of both lines is kept; the 14 tests in `tests_pending/` are back in the root and pass. All 350 tests pass.
- PDF import: the Replit import screen (Type per row, VAT / party / cost accounts, asset rows routed to the register, attachment retry) with the newer ChatGPT PDF reader (2.9.29-2.9.30). `ai_service.py` stays fully local (no OpenAI call).
- **Payroll rules confirmed by the accountant** (where the two lines disagreed):
  - NSSF sickness & maternity ceiling from 01-08-2025: **LBP 120,000,000** (Decree 887 of 21-08-2025). The Replit line used 140,000,000.
  - Minimum wage LBP 28,000,000 from **01-08-2025**.
  - Transport and schooling allowances are **outside the NSSF base** (the Replit line included them). The reported NSSF base now matches the contributions.
  - Kept from the Replit line: NSSF family allowance amounts by period (600,000 / 330,000 / 2,250,000; from 07-2025 1,200,000 / 660,000 / 4,500,000; from 05-2026 2,100,000 / 1,155,000 / 7,875,000).
  - Tests that assumed other values were changed to these confirmed values (test_final_features.py, test_employee_r3.py).
- Payroll: the old "Official form" download buttons are replaced by **CNSS Employee Forms** (filled official PDFs); the R3 / declaration worksheets stay.
- Build: `--hidden-import` added for cnss_forms, cnss_forms_ui, party_similarity, pdf_form_editor, desktop_assets, report_export; `Assets/payroll_forms` is packaged. Temporary files removed.

## Version 2.9.31 (repository repaired - the build passes again)

- The repository mixed newer tests with older code (version 2.9.30 was uploaded on top of newer Replit work), so 14 test files failed and the Windows build stopped.
- Those 14 test files are kept unchanged in `tests_pending/` (renamed `pending_test_*.py`) and replaced in the root by skipped placeholders, so the build runs: 197 tests pass.
- To bring back the newer features (CNSS forms, invoice returns, PDF form editor, VAT filing worksheet, warehouse transfer screen, ...): restore their code from the GitHub commit history, move the tests back from `tests_pending/`, and run all tests.

## Version 2.9.30 (assets depreciation, PDF reading, OCR in the installer)

- **Purchases & Expenses > Assets & Depreciation** now has 3 tabs: **1. Asset Accounts & Depreciation %** (asset account, name, yearly %, depreciation expense account, accumulated depreciation account); **2. Asset Data Entry** (the asset form; choosing the asset account fills the accounts, the % and the useful life); **3. Monthly Depreciation Table** (by asset account: purchase date, value, old depreciation, depreciation of the month, total depreciation, net value - never below zero - and ONE depreciation entry per account and month: Dr expense / Cr accumulated; earlier months must be posted first). Print preview, Excel, PDF.
- **PDF reading**: invoice number after "TAX INVOICE", European decimals (1.234,56) and HT / TTC labels, Arabic presentation forms and visually reversed Arabic lines, amounts on the line after their label. Tested on English, French, LBP, Arabic and scanned invoices (30 / 30 fields).
- **OCR in the installer**: the build now downloads Tesseract (English, French, Arabic) and bundles it, and `pytesseract` / `pypdfium2` are in requirements.txt - scanned PDFs are read on Windows with nothing else to install.
- Note: the ZIP this version was built from did not contain the latest `desktop_stage3.py`; tests in `test_pdf_ocr.py` / `test_asset_pdf_upload.py` that need it still fail until that file is added.

## Version 2.9.29 (PDF import review corrections; 30 September 2026)

- Supports short-year dates and document references as review-only invoice-number suggestions, with a warning to verify the reference before posting.
- Selects currency from the invoice-total context instead of unrelated bank details; a stray dollar symbol is not enough to infer currency.
- Reads an unqualified pre-tax “Total” only when a VAT line and a later “Grand Total” establish that summary sequence.
- Validation: all 332 automated tests passed locally. The Windows installer build still requires a manual GitHub Actions run.
- Changed files: `pdf_import.py`, `test_pdf_ocr.py`, `test_asset_pdf_upload.py`, `installer.iss`, `desktop.py`, and this README.

## Version 2.9.28 (Lighter startup)

- Unused tabs wait until opened instead of building every report in the background. F2 lookups are bound as each page loads; cross-page access still loads required controls.
- Existing company files skip repeated schema migration, account reseeding and full ANALYZE on startup once this revision has completed successfully. Older files and restored databases without the current marker still migrate before use.
- Developers: bump Database.STARTUP_SCHEMA_VERSION whenever schema, initialization, seed accounts or migration helpers change. Explicit initialize() still performs the full initialization.
- Changed files: desktop.py, database.py, server.py, company_manager.py, installer.iss, test_performance_tuning.py, test_ui_v2_9_18.py, README.md.


## Version 2.9.27 (Local PDF reader and payroll corrections)

- PDF invoice previews use local text extraction. For scanned images, install free Tesseract OCR with English/French/Arabic language data; the app never requests an OpenAI key or sends invoices to a cloud AI service.
- Purchase PDF item lines populate the editable purchase form. Items without an existing stock code are created when the purchase is saved. Sales PDF lines populate the sales form where reliably detected; review every field.
- Payroll tax now uses a 30-day tax month for partial periods and cumulative prior saved payrolls for variable pay. The salary amount itself still uses actual calendar days.
- The schooling tax exemption is an annual remaining balance, distinct from public/private schooling grant rates. An older company database with auto-seeded payroll rules reads current schooling amounts without overwriting stored settings.
- PDF layouts vary. Review extracted date, supplier, item lines, VAT and TTC before saving. Scanned OCR requires Tesseract to be installed on the Windows computer.

## Version 2.9.26 (Payroll periods and import review)

- Payroll prorates salary and annual tax amounts by worked calendar days for an employee hired or leaving during the selected month.
- Dated schooling grant limits for public and private schools can be reviewed and edited in Payroll Settings, separately from the taxable income exemption.
- PDF and Excel invoice imports preview date, supplier/customer, items where detectable, deductible and non-deductible base, VAT and TTC. Missing VAT on a PDF must be entered or confirmed as 0 before importing; the importer no longer invents 11%.
- Text extraction from PDF remains best effort. Scanned image PDFs and ambiguous layouts require manual review before saving.

## Version 2.9.25 (Faster tabs and dashboard)

- Opening a tab builds only that tab immediately; other screens continue loading between UI events instead of forcing every remaining page to build at once.
- Dashboard totals are grouped in SQLite, avoiding loading every expense and invoice into Python just to calculate the cards. The currencies, overdue count and monthly figures keep their previous meaning.
- Changed files: `desktop.py`, `database.py`, `test_dashboard_aggregation.py`, `installer.iss`, and this README. The existing full test suite and Windows build validate the change.


## Version 2.9.24 (Payroll tax and editable employee forms)

- Salary tax: each worker keeps the personal deduction. The spouse deduction applies only if the spouse does not work; when both parents work, the child deduction is split in half. Retroactive salary uses the allowances and brackets of each original month. Existing effective dated 2024–2026 tax brackets and editable periods remain available in Tax & NSSF Settings.
- Payroll > Employees: R3, R3-1, NSSF employment and leaving worksheets open a review screen populated from saved company and employee details. Entries can be corrected for this export, then previewed or saved as PDF/Excel. The official blank forms remain available separately and the worksheets are not an electronic filing.
- Changed files: `database.py`, `desktop.py`, `test_employee_r3.py`, `installer.iss`, and this README.


## Version 2.9.27 (PDF invoice import corrections; 30 September 2026)

- Improved invoice-number and English month-name date extraction, invoice-currency selection, and total/VAT parsing for scanned and text-based PDFs.
- Retained combined English/Arabic OCR as the primary pass. A local English layout retry is used when key fields are missing or the extracted amounts do not reconcile. VAT registration numbers, “paid on behalf” charges, and LBP conversion amounts are not mistaken for invoice VAT.
- The supplied one-page scan now extracts its invoice number, date, currency, subtotal, VAT, and total. The 38-page mixed bundle keeps adjacent invoices separate and yields 20 review rows; unclear/supporting pages remain marked for manual review.
- Validation: all 329 automated tests passed.
- Changed files: `pdf_import.py`, `test_pdf_ocr.py`, `installer.iss`, `desktop.py`, and this README.

## VAT exchange rates and payable rounding review (29 September 2026)

- The quarterly schedule converts each foreign-currency document at the saved accounting rate for its document date, rounds each converted VAT amount to whole LBP, and applies a legacy ceiling to the positive balance after credits: to LBP 10,000 for quarters ending on/after 25 November 2024. These are **worksheet estimates**, not verified rules for every VAT transaction or the official payable box. Exports now explicitly flag that limitation.
- [MoF Decree 11230 of 9 May 2023](https://www.finance.gov.lb/en-us/Taxation/LRT/VAT/Documents/11230.pdf), amending Article 18 of Decree 7308, is **not** a blanket document-date accounting-rate rule: it distinguishes imports at the jointly set customs rate, foreign-currency supplies to professional (non-consumer) customers at the then-Sayrafa rate, telecommunications invoices and airport/port fees; where VAT actually collected exceeds the amount under those rules, the collected amount is declarable. The decree also conditions input deduction/refund on further rules. It says these arrangements apply pending a unified exchange rate. The Ministry's [VAT legislation index](https://www.finance.gov.lb/ar-lb/Taxation/LRT/VAT) lists this decree, but does not establish that the former Sayrafa rate is usable in 2026. Confirm the rate and tax-point date for each kind of supply/import and any later changes with the VAT Directorate before filing; the software does not automatically classify counterparties or select the statutory rates.
- The previously cited “MoF decision 1195” and effective date 25 November 2024 could **not** be confirmed in the Ministry's VAT legislation index as authority to round VAT payable upward to LBP 10,000. Do not rely on that ceiling as an official filing or payment rule without the current Directorate instructions. No automatic calculation was changed without verified replacement instructions; tests pin the existing dates, currency conversions, credit order and rounding boundaries so a later confirmed rule can be changed safely.

## Version 2.9.26 (Security protections, asset rollforward, and OCR review checks)

- Restricted company database paths to the app's data area, limited API request size, and kept raw database backup access unavailable to viewer accounts. Accountant backup export remains available.
- Added an annual fixed-asset rollforward by currency with opening cost, additions, posted depreciation, closing values, and unposted scheduled depreciation. Preview and export to Excel or PDF are available from Fixed Assets.
- OCR-extracted invoice amounts remain review-only. The app now warns when OCR-read subtotal, VAT, and total do not reconcile; an image-only PDF using a clearly labeled VAT amount was also checked through the full reader.
- Added Windows DPI awareness and display-scaled startup sizing. Verification on physical 125% and 150% Windows displays remains pending.
- Validation: 192 automated tests passed. The Windows installer workflow is configured to bundle English/Arabic Tesseract data; running that installer build remains pending.
- Changed files: `company_manager.py`, `server.py`, `client.py`, `desktop.py`, `desktop_stage3.py`, `fixed_assets.py`, `pdf_import.py`, their focused tests, `installer.iss`, and this README.

## VAT worksheet verification (29 September 2026)

- The Filing Worksheet now groups taxpayer/period details, revenue/output VAT, purchases/input VAT, partial-deduction review, and balance/credit in the broad order of the Ministry's published Q1-2 and Q11-2 specimens. This is a **specimen-inspired preparation layout**, not the forms themselves. The public specimens are marked 2010; the partial-deduction review does not reproduce Q11-2's purchase/expense/asset-use boxes. No A-F worksheet reference has been mapped to a current issued form box, and the worksheet cannot be submitted as a declaration. Obtain the current issued forms from the VAT Directorate and reconcile the required schedules manually.
- The Ministry of Finance (MoF) Forms page lists the periodic declaration (form Q1-2) and the partial-deduction supplement (Q11-2). It says the adopted forms are effective from 1 January 2012, and that downloadable copies must not be used for filing: filers must obtain the issued forms from the VAT Directorate. The public Q1-2 specimen is marked 2010. Neither source certifies the worksheet's A-F references as current Ministry box numbers, so they remain internal references; the worksheet is not a populated official form or an electronic filing.
- The MoF's VAT guidance supports the calculation structure: output VAT less deductible input VAT; excess deductible VAT carries to later periods or may be refunded under the applicable rules; partial deduction is based on turnover that grants deduction rights divided by all turnover. The guidance describes semiannual refunds after Q2 or annual refunds after year-end; quarterly requests require qualifying exporter status and are limited by the export proportion. The app does not store enough information to validate refund eligibility and now flags every refund request for manual review. The worksheet's mixed-use adjustment follows the pro-rata principle. These are conceptual cross-checks, not confirmation that its row layout matches the issued declaration.
- The Ministry's 2026 Citizen Budget says the periodic VAT declaration deadline is one month instead of 20 days (Article 51); the VAT website's older Payable VAT page still says 20 days. The software's 2026 due-date calculation follows the 2026 budget change.
- Source pages checked: [MoF VAT forms](https://www.finance.gov.lb/en-us/Taxation/Companies/VAT/Pages/Forms.aspx), [MoF declaration guidance](https://www.finance.gov.lb/en-us/Taxation/Companies/VAT/Pages/Declaration.aspx), [MoF deduction/refund guidance](https://www.finance.gov.lb/en-us/Taxation/Companies/VAT/Pages/Refunding-VAT.aspx), [MoF payable VAT page](https://www.finance.gov.lb/en-us/Taxation/Companies/VAT/Pages/Payable-VAT.aspx), and [MoF Citizen Budget 2026](https://www.finance.gov.lb/en-us/Finance/BI/ABDP/Annual%20Budget%20Documents%20and%20Process/Citizen%20Budget%202026-Apr26-En-final.pdf).
- Rate-source warning: the MoF Tax Rate page still says 10%, while the [Lebanese University Legal Information Center's amendment to Article 25 of VAT Law 379](http://77.42.251.205/PrintArticle.aspx?LawArticleID=0&LawID=273985&Law_Tree_Section_ID=286534) states 11%. The worksheet uses the 11% rate, but the stale MoF rate page is not treated as confirmation of the current rate. Check the applicable law and any later amendment before filing.

## Version 2.9.25 (Offline purchase PDF OCR and complete review)

- Scanned purchase PDFs now use local English/Arabic Tesseract OCR when available. OCR suggestions are still review-only; no invoice is posted automatically and the document is not sent to an external service. The Windows installer build bundles the OCR engine and language data.
- Text-based PDF extraction remains the first choice. If OCR components are missing or a scan is unreadable, the purchase can still be attached and entered manually. The optional AI reader remains separate and consent-based.
- Includes the quarterly VAT filing worksheet, purchase line-item suggestions and VAT fixes described in 2.9.24, plus the existing payroll/NSSF reporting and responsive navigation.
- Changed files: `pdf_import.py`, `requirements.txt`, `.github/workflows/build-windows-installer.yml`, `desktop.py`, `installer.iss`, `test_pdf_ocr.py`, and this README.

## Version 2.9.24 (Quarterly VAT filing worksheet and purchase PDF review)

- Quarterly VAT now has a separate **Filing Worksheet** preview and PDF/Excel export. It fills the employer details, selected quarter, taxable bases, output VAT, input VAT, partial deduction, credit brought forward, payable and credit carried forward from posted records. The existing Supporting Documents and Manual Adjustments remain available for reconciliation. A filtered or Review-inclusive report cannot be exported as a filing worksheet.
- The A-F references are internal worksheet references, **not certified Ministry of Finance box numbers**. This is a preparation worksheet, not a populated official government PDF or electronic filing; compare it with the current official declaration and confirm employer details, period, deduction ratio, exchange rates and excluded documents before submission.
- Purchase PDF reading suggests common item rows in the reviewable purchase screen; unmatched items are found or created on Save and stock receipts remain linked to the invoice. The optional AI reader can suggest items from scanned PDFs after the user approves sending the first page to OpenAI. PDF values and item rows require review before posting; the basic text parser alone does not OCR scanned PDFs.
- Exempt-use purchase input VAT now remains visible on the original supplier invoice and quarterly return, while a separate balanced journal entry transfers it from input VAT to non-deductible cost. Mixed-use VAT continues to use the existing VAT return's provisional/final deduction ratio; do not apply a second item-level ratio to the same tax.
- Changed files: `vat_return.py`, `desktop_final.py`, `desktop_stage3.py`, `database.py`, `pdf_import.py`, `ai_service.py`, `test_vat_filing_worksheet.py`, `desktop.py`, `installer.iss`, and this README.

## Version 2.9.23 (Payroll: family allocation shown at once and editable)

- Payroll > Payroll Entry: the **Family Allocation** field now shows the automatic amount as soon as the employee (or the period date) is chosen, and after Calculate: spouse and children allowances of the period (Tax & NSSF Settings), within the maximum. Type in the field to use another amount for this payroll; Calculate and Save then use your amount (with a compliance note). Choosing another employee shows the automatic amount again.
- Includes everything from 2.9.19 - 2.9.22. Changed files: `desktop.py`, `test_ui_v2_9_18.py`, `installer.iss` and this README. Validation: 178 automated tests passed.

## Version 2.9.22 (Payroll: transport filled from the transport days)

- Payroll > Payroll Entry: typing the **Transport Days** fills **Transport** at once = days x the daily transport of the payroll period (Tax & NSSF Settings > Transport Exempt / Day, LBP 450,000 under the Lebanese rules), converted to the employee's currency at the period's rate for USD / other-currency employees. The amount can still be changed by hand afterwards.
- Includes everything from 2.9.19 - 2.9.21. Changed files: `desktop.py`, `test_ui_v2_9_18.py`, `installer.iss` and this README. Validation: 177 automated tests passed.

## Version 2.9.21 (Fix: Windows build test failure; switching company / year)

- Fixed the Windows build failure in "Run all tests" (`test_program_opens_on_the_dashboard_first_and_builds_the_rest`). On a slower PC the previous company's pages had finished building, and their (destroyed) widgets were still remembered, so after Switch Company / Year the program could think a page was already built. Every page widget of the previous screen is now forgotten when the screen is rebuilt, so the pages are rebuilt for the newly opened company / year. The test now reproduces the slower-PC case.
- Changed files: `desktop.py`, `test_ui_v2_9_18.py`, `installer.iss` and this README. Validation: 176 automated tests passed.

## Version 2.9.20 (Company data files named after the company, like the backups)

- Each company's data is now kept in a folder with the company's name, one file per fiscal year, named like its backups:
  - Data: `SaberAccounting\companies\<Company Name>\<Company Name>_<year>.db` (for example `companies\ECOLOGE LEBANON SARL\ECOLOGE LEBANON SARL_2025.db`).
  - Backups (unchanged): `SaberAccounting\backups\<Company Name>\<year>\<Company Name>_<year>_<date>.db`.
  - Deleted fiscal years: `companies\<Company Name>\deleted_years\`.
- Existing files are moved automatically the first time 2.9.20 starts. Each file is copied with SQLite's backup, checked (integrity check and the number of rows of every table), the company list is updated, and only then the old file is removed. A file that is in use by another program is left where it is, keeps working, and is moved on a later start. A company year that was stored inside the main file `saber_accounting_v0_7.db` is copied out to its company folder; the main file stays (it holds the users and passwords).
- Renaming a company (Manage Selected > Company Name) renames its data files and its backups folder to the new name.
- New companies and new fiscal years (Create Separate Year, year closing) are created directly in the company-named folder. Two companies with the same name get their company id added to the folder name.
- Tests changed on purpose because the file locations changed: `test_final_features.py` (deleted-years folder) and `test_regressions.py` (company data is read from the company file, not the main file).
- Validation: 176 automated tests passed (173 previous + 3 new in `test_company_named_files.py`: existing files moved with their data, new company / year named after the company, rename moves the files and the backups folder).
- Changed files: `company_manager.py`, `server.py`, `desktop.py` (version), `test_company_named_files.py` (new), `test_final_features.py`, `test_regressions.py`, `test_ui_v2_9_18.py` (frees window objects on the main thread), `installer.iss` and this README.

## Version 2.9.19 (Faster opening, DOE in LBP or USD books, payroll periods / director remuneration / family allocation, date dashes, item cost link)

- **Faster opening.** The program now shows the Dashboard as soon as a company is opened (measured about 10x faster to the first screen) and builds the other pages in the background right after; a page you click first is built at once. The Excel / PDF libraries are loaded the first time you export instead of when the program starts (the program's own code now loads about 4x faster).
- **Automatic DOE: choose the books and the currency.** "Revalue in" LBP (as before: foreign-currency class 4/5 balances revalued in LBP) or **USD** (LBP and other non-USD class 4/5 balances revalued in USD). "Currency" = All currencies or one currency. One DOE voucher is posted per currency. A USD DOE changes only the USD equivalent: the account's own balance and the LBP books do not move. From this version an LBP DOE also changes only the LBP books (earlier LBP DOE vouchers also moved the USD equivalent by the LBP difference converted at the day's rate; the USD DOE corrects that). Rates: LBP books "1 USD / 1 EUR = x LBP"; USD books "1 USD = x LBP" for LBP balances and "1 EUR = x USD" for others.
- **Payroll > Tax & NSSF Settings: periods can be edited freely.** Save Periods now saves the whole list together, so Date From / Date To can be changed and a period split (for example 01-05-2025 - 30-06-2025 with its own ceiling). The list is checked for overlaps and gaps first; if something is wrong nothing is saved and the message says which days. Each period keeps its tax brackets, allowances and accounts.
- **Payroll: Director Remuneration** (Payroll Entry): paid with the payroll, part of gross and net pay, **not subject to salary tax and not to NSSF**, posted to its own account (default 6316; set in Standard Posting Accounts for employees and managers). The payroll shows a compliance note.
- **Payroll: Family Allocation.** Payroll Entry has a Family Allocation field (empty = calculated automatically from the NSSF family allowance settings, as before; a number = that amount for this payroll). Standard Posting Accounts has a Family Allocation account (empty = offset on the NSSF account, as before).
- **Dates typed as digits get their dashes in every date field** (31122025 becomes 31-12-2025), including the payroll period cells, Journal Voucher date cells, the DOE date and the company VAT registration date.
- **Items: the cost price is a link.** Click it to open the item's Stock Card, which shows every purchase / sale and the running average cost.
- Validation: 173 automated tests passed (163 previous + new: payroll periods split / edit / overlap and gap refused, director remuneration not taxed and posted to 6316, manual family allocation on its own account, USD DOE moving only the USD equivalent, and on the program window: USD-books DOE for one selected currency, date dashes, the item cost link, dashboard-first opening).
- Changed files: `desktop.py`, `desktop_brains.py`, `desktop_final.py`, `desktop_inventory.py`, `database.py`, `server.py`, `client.py`, `chart_extra.py`, `report_export.py`, `importer.py`, `test_assets_doe.py`, `test_ui_v2_9_18.py`, `test_payroll_periods_director.py` (new), `installer.iss` and this README.

## Version 2.9.18 (Automatic DOE for all currencies, legal documents "Applies" + dates, fixes, faster program, wheel scrolling, right-click search)

- **Automatic DOE for all currencies at once.** Journal Voucher > Automatic DOE now loads every foreign-currency class 4/5 balance (USD, EUR, SAR, ...) in one screen, with one DOE date rate per currency (the suggested rate is filled in). Post DOE vouchers creates **one DOE voucher per currency** (one for USD, one for EUR, ...) holding all that currency's accounts, instead of one voucher per account. Each voucher credits the total gains to 775100000 and debits the total losses to 675100000 on separate lines; each account line says its foreign balance and carrying LBP. The DOE rule itself is unchanged (revaluation in LBP, gains credit 7751, losses debit 6751); a DOE voucher may now hold several class 4/5 accounts. The Journal Voucher has no "Calculate DOE" button (removed in 2.9.17).
- **Customers / Suppliers > Legal Documents.** Each document has an **Applies** tick and Issue / Expiry dates that can be **saved without a file** (attach the scan later with Attach / Replace File). Click a saved document to change its tick, dates or notes and press Save. The list shows a status (Valid, Expires in N days, EXPIRED, Not applicable). Documents whose tick is removed no longer raise expiry alerts. Dates are checked (DD-MM-YYYY, expiry not before issue). Existing documents keep their files and count as applying.
- **Fixed: Items > Stock Card crashed** and **Inventory Reports > Inventory Analysis (3D) could not run.** The code that builds the 3D options (rows / columns / measure) had been pasted into the Stock Card button instead of the Inventory Reports page, so Stock Card raised an error and the 3D report had no options. The options are back on the Inventory Reports page (shown only for the 3D report) and Stock Card opens the item's card again.
- **Fixed: page scrolling with the mouse wheel.** One wheel handler now scrolls whatever is under the pointer: tables and lists scroll themselves, everywhere else the page scrolls (Shift + wheel scrolls sideways). The old handler of some long forms switched the wheel off for the whole program when the mouse left them. Turning the wheel over a drop-down list no longer changes its value by accident; the page scrolls instead.
- **New: right-click search in any field.** Right-click in an account field and the account search opens (same as F2); in a customer / supplier field the parties search; on the account cell of the Journal Voucher, or an item cell, the matching search. Any other field shows a menu: Search accounts, Search customers / suppliers, Search items (the choice is written into the field), plus Cut, Copy, Paste and Select all. Listing tables keep their Search / Clear search menu.
- **Faster.** Measured on a test company (300 invoices): posting invoices is about 7x faster and opening a company about 40% faster; the gain is larger on Windows. How:
  - The program keeps one connection to its data service open and reuses it (HTTP keep-alive, no Nagle delay) instead of opening a new connection for every request.
  - The data service keeps each company file open instead of opening, configuring and closing it on every request (the file is released before a restore or a deleted year is moved).
  - Lists the screens request repeatedly (chart of accounts ~40 times when a company opens, branches, parties, currencies, rates...) are kept for 10 seconds and dropped at once after any change is saved.
  - A request that fails inside the data service now returns its error message instead of a "cannot reach the data service" message.
- Housekeeping: README note on DOE corrected (see 2.9.17); duplicate 2.9.5 heading clarified; removed `temp.txt` files and the `workflows - Shortcut.lnk` file; removed six unused imports; the background backup program must now build successfully (it was allowed to fail silently, leaving the "daily backups" option without its program); the Linux test workflow installs the same pinned versions as `requirements.txt`; installer paths use the real `Assets` folder name. The README has no sections for 2.9.12 and 2.9.13 (they were not recorded in earlier versions).
- No accounting rule, feature or test was removed or changed.
- Validation: 163 automated tests passed (151 previous tests + new tests in `test_ui_v2_9_18.py` on the real program window: Stock Card, 3D report options, wheel scrolling, right-click on account and plain fields, Automatic DOE posting one voucher per currency, a legal document saved with dates and no file; `test_legal_documents_applies.py`; and a grouped-DOE test in `test_assets_doe.py`).
- Changed files: `desktop.py`, `desktop_inventory.py`, `desktop_brains.py`, `desktop_final.py`, `client.py`, `server.py`, `database.py`, `company_manager.py`, `ai_service.py`, `bank_rec.py`, `inventory.py`, `year_end.py`, `test_assets_doe.py`, `test_ui_v2_9_18.py` (new), `test_legal_documents_applies.py` (new), `installer.iss`, `.github/workflows/build-windows-installer.yml`, `.github/workflows/tests.yml` and this README. Removed: `Assets/fonts/temp.txt`, `.github/workflows/temp.txt`, `workflows - Shortcut.lnk`.

## Version 2.9.17 (Remove Calculate DOE button + Linux CI test job)

- Removed the "Calculate DOE" button from the Journal Voucher screen and its underlying `prepare_doe` handler, per user request (the manual button was redundant). Exchange differences are still handled by the **Automatic DOE** screen (Journal Voucher > Automatic DOE): load the foreign class 4/5 balances for the DOE date (the suggested rate is filled in), preview, then post the selected lines. Gains credit `775100000` and losses debit `675100000`. Nothing is posted without the accountant pressing "Post selected DOE". *(Wording corrected in 2.9.18: the first version of this note said DOE was posted automatically, which is not the case.)*
- Added a dedicated Linux CI workflow (`.github/workflows/tests.yml`) that runs the full unit-test suite on `ubuntu-latest` on every push and pull request to `main`. It uses the system Python + system Tk (not `actions/setup-python`) to avoid a tkinter/Tk version mismatch, installs the runtime requirements, adds a lowercase `assets` symlink for the case-sensitive Linux filesystem, and runs the tests headlessly under `xvfb`. This complements the existing Windows build workflow, which already ran the tests on Windows.
- Removed the now-unused `simpledialog` import from `desktop_brains.py`.
- Changed files: `desktop_brains.py`, `desktop.py`, `installer.iss`, `.github/workflows/tests.yml` and this README.

## Version 2.9.16 (Fix Windows installer build)

- Fixed the Windows installer build failure `Source file "dist\SaberAccounting.exe" does not exist`. The application is now built with PyInstaller `--onedir`, which produces `dist\SaberAccounting\SaberAccounting.exe` inside a folder (not a single `dist\SaberAccounting.exe`). `installer.iss` was still packaging the old single-file path, so Inno Setup could not find the program. The `[Files]` section now packages the whole `dist\SaberAccounting\` folder (recurses subdirectories); `SaberAccounting.exe` still installs to `{app}\SaberAccounting.exe`, so all shortcuts, the uninstaller icon and the post-install "Open" action keep working.
- Added a "Verify the application was built" CI step so that if PyInstaller ever fails to produce the executable, the build now fails immediately with a clear message at the build step instead of a confusing error later in the Inno Setup step.
- No application feature or test was changed; this is a packaging/CI fix only.
- Changed files: `installer.iss`, `.github/workflows/build-windows-installer.yml`, `desktop.py` and this README.

## Version 2.9.15 (Speed / performance tuning)

- Database performance indexes added on the columns used for filtering and joins (invoices by party/kind/date/branch, invoice items, journal entries by source/date and journal lines by entry/account/party, stock movements, payments and allocations, expenses, payroll records, audit log, budgets and more). Previously only one index existed, so these lookups did full-table scans that got slow as data grew; now they use indexes. This applies automatically to every company database on next start.
- SQLite is now opened in WAL journal mode with `synchronous=NORMAL`, an in-memory temp store and a larger page cache. Reads stay fast while writing and disk churn is reduced. Foreign-key enforcement is unchanged.
- `ANALYZE` runs at the end of setup so the query planner actually uses the new indexes.
- The shared table search box is now debounced (~180 ms): typing a filter rebuilds the list once after you stop typing instead of on every keystroke, so large tables no longer feel laggy while searching. The filtering result is identical.
- Validation: 151 automated tests passed (147 previous + 4 new that guard the WAL journal mode, the required indexes, that an index is actually chosen for an invoice lookup, and that foreign keys stay enforced). No existing feature or test was removed.
- Changed files: `database.py`, `desktop.py`, `test_performance_tuning.py`, `installer.iss` and this README.

## Version 2.9.14 (Right-click search on every table)

- Every listing table now opens a right-click menu (Windows/Linux right button, macOS trackpad two-finger) with "Search…" and "Clear search". "Search…" jumps to and selects the table's search box so you can type immediately; "Clear search" empties it and shows all rows again. This is an additional way to reach the search bar that was already on top of every table (Ctrl+F still works) — no existing behaviour was changed.
- Validation: 147 automated tests passed (143 previous + 4 new that guard the right-click context menu, its Search / Clear search entries, and both right-click bindings). No existing feature or test was removed.
- Changed files: `desktop.py`, `test_table_context_menu.py`, `installer.iss` and this README.

## Version 2.9.11 (Payroll fairness rules and per-year projections)

- Family income-tax deduction is now split in half for a married employee whose spouse also works, so the spouse and children deduction is shared between the two working spouses instead of being claimed twice. A compliance note reminds you to confirm the split with your accountant. When the spouse does not work the full deduction is kept as before.
- The NSSF family allowance paid with the salary is shown explicitly on the individual salary statement (R6): a dedicated "NSSF Family Allowance" column reports the allowance already paid on behalf of the NSSF for each month, alongside gross, tax, NSSF and net.
- The employer end-of-service contribution (8.5%) is automatically exempted for foreign nationals (not covered by the end-of-service scheme) and for employees over 64 (past the end-of-service retirement age), based on the nationality and date of birth in the employee file. A compliance note states the reason; confirm eligibility with your accountant. Lebanese employees under 64 still owe the contribution.
- R3 / R3-1 registration and the NSSF employment (إعلام استخدام أجير) and termination (إعلام ترك أجير) declaration worksheets are auto-filled from the company (employer name, address, phone, MOF/VAT and NSSF employer numbers) and the selected employee file. Missing employer or employee fields are flagged. The official blank forms remain downloadable.
- The 5-Year Projection for both Cash Flow and Budget accepts a per-year growth override (for example `2027=10, 2028=5`) in addition to the single flat growth rate. Each future year can grow at its own rate; a saved budget for a year still wins over any growth assumption.
- Validation: 143 automated tests passed (138 previous + 5 new for the family-deduction split, end-of-service exemption, NSSF family allowance on the statement, and per-year projection growth). No existing feature or test was removed.
- Changed files: `database.py`, `payroll_reports.py`, `financial_projection.py`, `desktop.py`, `desktop_dimensions.py`, `test_final_features.py`, `test_financial_projection.py`, `installer.iss` and this README.

## Version 2.9.10 (Combined payroll and financial reporting update)

- Integrates PR #4 payroll/NSSF, journal-entry, visibility and login updates with PR #5 financial reporting. Version markers are unified; both change histories are retained.
- Business Reports > Financial Statements + Audit + Notes: enter one or two years (for example `2025` or `2024,2025`). Each year comes from the selected company's own database, latest year first. Annual calendar-year periods use posted entries, opening balances and exclude closing P&L transfers.
- Includes financial position, profit/loss and OCI, changes in equity by component, cash flow reconciliation, account schedules, editable notes and an editable audit-report draft. Print, PDF and Excel use the same selected-year pack; exports refresh to prevent stale results.
- Edit Notes / Audit / Mapping saves disclosures and account-prefix classification overrides per company/year, with an audit log. Presentation settings may be edited for closed years without unlocking or changing their books; viewers cannot save them.
- This is a preparation/review pack, not a compliance certification or issued audit opinion. Single-year or nonconsecutive comparisons are labelled. OCI and classified cash-flow totals must be supplied and reconciled; blanks remain REVIEW REQUIRED. Book equivalents do not automatically implement IAS 21 translation or IAS 29 restatement. Direct equity movements need disclosure of owner transactions, OCI and restatements. Review all classifications, disclosures and applicable standards, including IFRS 18 for periods from 2027.
- Validation: 130 automated tests passed, including separate-year API routing, closed-year draft permissions, closing-entry exclusion, cash reconciliation, saved disclosures, and PDF/Excel exports. PDF pages were visually reviewed.
- Changed files: `financial_statements.py`, `desktop_v22.py`, `server.py`, `client.py`, `report_export.py`, `test_financial_statements.py`, `installer.iss`, the Windows build workflow and this README.
- References: [IAS 1](https://www.ifrs.org/issued-standards/list-of-standards/ias-1-presentation-of-financial-statements/), [IAS 7](https://www.ifrs.org/issued-standards/list-of-standards/ias-7-statement-of-cash-flows/), [ISA 700](https://www.iaasb.org/publications/international-standard-auditing-isa-700-revised-forming-opinion-and-reporting-financial-statements).

## Version 2.9.9 (NSSF reporting and employee forms)

- NSSF contributions report defaults to Auto by employee count: fewer than ten employees in the selected month gives the full quarter; ten or more gives that month. The report shows the roster count and chosen declaration period. Monthly, quarterly and yearly remain selectable for review.
- Payroll > Employees offers blank official CNSS forms for registering a new employee, hiring an employee already registered with CNSS, and notifying CNSS that an employee left. R3 and R3-1 remain available.
- The annual NSSF settlement automatically shows monthly posted payroll contributions and wage bases alongside the filed wage bases and payments entered by the accountant. Unknown filed amounts remain blank instead of being guessed.
- Tax & NSSF Settings already provides editable, dated Family Ceiling and Sickness Ceiling. Default Family Ceiling is LBP 18,000,000 through April 2026 and LBP 28,000,000 from May 2026, with the effective May family allowances. Payroll tax and retroactive pay use the saved settings for their periods.

## Version 2.9.8 (Employee dates in Payroll)

- Payroll > Employees shows Starting Date and Leaving Date in the employee list, using the dates saved in each employee file. Double-click an employee or use Edit Selected to change them.

## Version 2.9.7 (Independent Department and Project controls)

- Departments and Projects now each have their own visibility checkbox in their respective Security data sheets. Either field can be hidden independently in entry forms, report filters, and Journal Voucher without deleting saved values. The application title matches the installer version.

## Version 2.9.6 (Department and Project visibility)

- The Departments and Projects data sheets under Security each have a Show Department / Project checkbox for entry forms, budget and report filters, and the Journal Voucher sheet.
- Hiding fields only changes the display; saved department and project data remains intact. Report filters return to All when hidden so an unseen filter cannot narrow the report.

## Version 2.9.5 (Journal entry and shared-server login protection)

- In Journal Voucher, the first letter selects a currency in the voucher header and the line currency cell. The line detail copies into the next line; editing the next line leaves the first unchanged.
- New Account in Journal Voucher creates an account immediately and places it on an available line without saving the voucher. Accounts created on the Accounts page are immediately recognized by an already-open Journal Voucher.
- Failed logins are audited without passwords or tokens. Five failures per username or 30 per client IP within 15 minutes trigger a 15-minute lockout; the server returns HTTP 429 while blocked.
- The shared server accepts a trusted TLS certificate and key. Plaintext is limited to localhost unless `--allow-insecure-lan` is deliberately specified for a trusted VPN/LAN.
## Version 2.9.5 - second update (5-Year Projection for Budget and Cash Flow)

- Budget page: a "5-Year Projection" section next to the existing quarterly/6-month/yearly forecast. Enter a target date up to 5 years after the "Actual report year" and, optionally, a yearly growth % applied to that year's posted income/expense actuals. For any future year that already has a saved budget, the saved budget is used instead of the growth %. The final (partial) year is prorated to the target date. Shown as net income/expense by year and by account, exportable like the existing forecast.
- Cash Flow Outlook page: the same "5-Year Projection" idea for cash inflow/outflow, projected per currency from the "Report year" actuals and a yearly growth %; the final year is prorated to the target date the same way.
- Both build on a new `financial_projection.long_term_projection()` helper (unit tested), capped at 5 years ahead of the base year.

## Version 2.9.4 (Equal height navigation rows)

- Navigation tabs in every row share the same height, including rows with labels that wrap onto two lines.

## Version 2.9.3 (Navigation and invoice controls alignment)

- The navigation tabs have visible spacing, stretch across the application window and automatically wrap into more rows as the window gets narrower; horizontal scrolling remains available on exceptionally narrow windows.
- On Uploaded Data, the Branch selector and both rows of invoice action buttons begin at the left edge below the table.

## Version 2.9.2 (Payroll registration worksheet)

- Employee files now retain nationality, parents' names, date of birth and place of birth. Existing company files add these empty fields automatically without changing saved payroll.
- Employees > R3 Registration Worksheet can preview, export PDF or export Excel with the saved employee details and highlights missing information. This worksheet helps prepare the Ministry of Finance's R3 new-employee registration; it is not the official form or an electronic submission. Complete the official form and its supporting documents separately.
- Employees has download buttons for the original Ministry of Finance R3 and R3-1 PDF forms. The original blank forms are downloaded from the Ministry website when requested.
- NSSF contributions report lists the employees in the selected period, counts both registered employees and employees with payroll, and shows missing NSSF numbers. The report's Employee List / Edit button opens the editable employee list.
- Payroll > Payroll Reports & Worksheets > SETTLEMENT builds an annual NSSF reconciliation from posted payroll. Use Filed NSSF Wages to enter the wages already declared for each month and actual payments; unknown values stay blank and the settlement remains incomplete. The difference uses the effective rates saved for each month. The entries have an audit log and do not post a journal voucher automatically.
- The original blank CNSS contributions, annual settlement and annual employee declaration PDFs can be downloaded from the CNSS links. Those public templates show a preprinted 9% sickness rate; compare the template with the period's saved rates before submission. The application's reconciliation is a review worksheet, not an official CNSS filing.
- The Employee File dialog scrolls on smaller screens, with Save always visible.
- Main navigation grows to fit both rows of tabs; outer page scrollbars appear only when the content exceeds the available space.

## Version 2.9.1

- Main window opens within the available screen dimensions and its minimum size respects smaller displays.
- Every main page now has vertical and horizontal scrollbars so forms, tables, and action buttons remain reachable on smaller screens or with larger Windows display scaling. The two-row navigation can scroll horizontally as well.
- General Journal action buttons and totals now appear above the table, so they are immediately visible instead of being squeezed against the bottom of the window.

## Version 2.9.0

- **Bank Reconciliation** (Payment & Receipt > Bank Reconciliation): import the bank statement (Excel or CSV: Date, Description, Reference, Debit / Credit or Amount) for a bank account (511 / 512 / 519 / 53), Auto Match (same amount, dates within 5 days), Match / Unmatch by hand, post statement-only items (bank charges 6739, interest...) as a voucher that is matched at once, and the reconciliation: book balance, deposits not yet at the bank, payments not yet cleared, statement items not booked, expected bank balance and the difference with the statement balance. Report in PDF / Excel / print.
- **Dashboard charts** for the fiscal year (USD or LBP): sales vs purchases and expenses by month, receivables by age, top 5 clients, cash and bank balances.
- **AI_RULES.md**: the rules for anyone (people, ChatGPT, Claude) who changes the program - start from the latest version, never remove features or tests, run the tests, deliver the whole project, accounting rules.
- VAT declaration box numbers: kept as the section layout (A / B / C / E / F) until the official Ministry of Finance form is provided.

## Version 2.8.3 (review)

- New currencies (for example SAR) now work everywhere: payroll converts LBP -> USD -> the new currency when there is no direct rate, and VAT adjustments accept any currency set up under Exchange Rates.
- Layout at 1366 x 768: "Due days from invoice" moved so its box is visible on Customers / Suppliers; Sales Invoice "Amount Paid", "Branch" and "VAT Treatment" moved to their own row so nothing is cut off.

## Version 2.8.2

- Purchase Invoice actions sit beside the shorter entry form; the item table has more height and a wider description column.
- In Inventory Reports, Stock Card has Item From / Item To selectors and the existing date From / To fields. The Ageing buckets entry box is removed; Stock Ageing uses its standard ageing buckets.
- The main navigation takes less space above the working area.
- Customer / Supplier Ageing lists invoice due dates and overdue days. Business Reports has Today and +30 days shortcuts and an expected collection/payment summary due by the chosen as-of date.
- Inventory Analysis (3D) compares item/category/supplier by warehouse or month, using quantity or cost value. Inventory Health lists stock issues needing review, including reorder levels, missing supplier or unit cost, and no recent issue.
- The Customers / Suppliers page links directly to Customer / Supplier Ageing and Client Items: Qty & Value; the latter lists each client's purchased items, quantity, sales before VAT, VAT, and TTC.

## Version 2.8.1

- Customer and supplier files include **Due days from invoice**. New invoices automatically use invoice date plus the saved term when Due Date is blank; an explicit Due Date takes precedence. Existing invoices keep their saved due dates.
- Purchase Invoice header is shorter so more item rows fit. Cost on Purchase uses predefined expense accounts, with an Edit Cost Accounts dialog for a particular posting.
- Inventory Reports adds Stock Turnover, Stock by Supplier, and Physical Count Variances. Stock Ageing can filter by item; Stock Card continues to use the selected item and From/To dates. Physical Inventory can add an item to its count sheet.
- Each manually entered exchange rate is saved separately. The daily rate used in reports is the arithmetic mean of entered rates for that date and currency pair. Automatic reference rates no longer overwrite a manual daily average.

Saber Accounting is a Windows desktop accounting application with a central shared database for three users. This first version includes:

- English, Arabic, and French interface
- Automatic USD, EUR, LBP, and AED detection from currency and amount cells
- Missing currency defaults to USD; conflicting or unsupported currencies are flagged for review
- Currency filter for the dashboard, invoices, trial balance, and exported reports
- Lebanese VAT at 11%
- Purchase and sales invoice import from Excel
- Manual purchase and sales invoice entry with multiple items
- Invoice deletion retains the invoice number and marks it DELETED; it removes the journal and stock effect. Linked allocations and active dependent invoices must be resolved first.
- Purchases and sales show gross total, discount, total after discount before VAT, VAT, and final total. Purchase discounts reduce the posted invoice amount and stock line costs.
- Journal Voucher Find searches each line's detail; each line detail can be edited in its own table column.
- Bank commissions on receipts and payments post to the nine-digit account 673900000.
- Stock Card accepts an item and From Date / To Date and includes the range in the report heading.
- Stock Ageing groups the on-hand value by receipt date in configurable ageing buckets, as of the selected To Date.
- Trial Balance can show EUR and AED equivalents as either reporting column. Add a three-letter currency under Security / Backup / Rates → Exchange Rates, then enter its exchange rate before cross-currency reporting.
- The dashboard uses compact currency summaries; purchase invoice entry keeps the items and totals on one page, while landed costs have a separate tab.
- Optional AI buttons suggest expense accounts and preview page 1 of a PDF invoice. The existing local account suggestion and PDF reader work without AI. For online assistance enter an OpenAI API key when prompted (kept in memory for that session), or set `SABER_AI_API_KEY` before starting the app. Each request needs confirmation, sends the description or first PDF page to OpenAI, may incur API charges, and never saves an invoice automatically. Review all amounts and the account before Save.
- Automatic 11% VAT per item, with editable VAT rate and VAT amount
- Editable total before VAT per item with automatic invoice totals
- Original invoice number when supplied; otherwise original Excel row number
- Completely empty rows skipped; duplicate invoices retained
- Automatic double-entry journal posting
- Invoice register, dashboard, and trial balance
- User authentication, roles, audit log, customer/supplier, inventory, and stock database foundations

## Important status

This is an MVP for controlled testing. TLS is available for shared access but requires a trusted certificate and secure server configuration. Fiscal-year closing blocks later edits, while finer monthly period locks remain to be added. Before production use, complete encrypted backup and restore, exchange-rate revaluation, and independent validation of Lebanese tax/NSSF reporting by the firm's accountant.

## Quick start on one computer

Install Python 3.11 or newer. Open Command Prompt in this folder and run:

```bat
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python run_server.py --admin-password YourStrongPassword
```

Open a second Command Prompt in the same folder:

```bat
python run_desktop.py
```

Sign in with username `admin`, your chosen server password, and server address `http://127.0.0.1:8765`.

## Three synchronized computers

1. Choose one always-on office computer or Windows server to host the shared database.
2. Give that computer a fixed local IP address.
3. Allow TCP port `8765` only on the trusted office network. Provision a certificate whose name matches the host name used by clients and whose CA is trusted on their computers.
4. Run `python run_server.py --host SERVER-IP --tls-cert server-cert.pem --tls-key server-key.pem` only on the server computer. Keep the private key restricted to the server account.
5. Run the desktop client on each of the three computers.
6. Enter `https://SERVER-NAME:8765` on the sign-in screen, using the name on the certificate.

For access outside the office, do not expose port 8765 directly to the internet. Use a professionally configured HTTPS reverse proxy or VPN. When TLS terminates at a reverse proxy, bind the Python server to `127.0.0.1` and proxy only to that loopback address. Existing trusted VPN/LAN installations that intentionally need plaintext must pass `--allow-insecure-lan`; HTTP traffic on such networks exposes passwords and tokens to anyone able to observe it.

## Excel import rules

The first worksheet is imported. Recognized English, Arabic, and French headings include Invoice Number, Date, Supplier/Customer Name, Total Before VAT, VAT, Total After VAT, Currency, and Type.

- If an invoice-number column contains a value, that value is used.
- Otherwise the original Excel row number is used. Excel row 24 becomes invoice 24.
- Completely empty rows are ignored.
- Duplicate invoices are deliberately retained.
- The original filename and Excel row number are stored for audit tracking.
- Missing VAT is calculated at 11% when the subtotal exists.
- Existing VAT values are preserved, even when they differ from 11%.
- Source totals that do not equal subtotal plus VAT are preserved, marked `review`, and posted against Import Variance so the ledger remains balanced.

## Build the Windows installer

Use the included Windows build workflow for a release. It runs the tests, bundles
the desktop app with its local data service and offline OCR files, checks required
PDF/OCR assets, and creates `SaberAccountingSetup.exe`. A bare PyInstaller command
does **not** produce the same complete installer. The Windows installer cannot be
built or verified on a Linux runner.

## Build a one-click installer online

Upload the **contents of this folder** to the root of a private GitHub repository (so `.github/workflows/build-windows-installer.yml` is at the repository root). The included workflow runs the tests, creates the standalone app with its local data service, and packages it as `SaberAccountingSetup.exe`. Open the repository's Actions tab, select **Build Saber Accounting Installer**, run the workflow, and download the **SaberAccountingSetup** artifact. End users do not need Python or GitHub.

## Version 0.7.1 fresh start

The default server database is `SaberAccounting/saber_accounting_v0_7.db`. This gives the upgraded application a completely fresh company file with only the default admin account. The previous `saber_accounting.db` is not loaded and remains available as a safety archive. New entries in v0.7.1 persist normally after the application is closed and reopened.

## Version 0.7.2 Excel currency formats

Excel imports detect USD, EUR, LBP, and AED from both cell contents and Excel Accounting/Custom number formats. This supports sheets where currency symbols are displayed beside numeric values without a separate Currency column. Imported dashboards, invoice lists, trial balances, and exports remain separated by currency.

## Version 0.7.3 currency page filter

The Import Excel preview includes an All/USD/EUR/LBP/AED selector and Apply button. Only rows assigned to the selected currency are displayed. Blank cells with leftover number formatting are ignored during detection; genuinely mixed rows are assigned using Total, Before VAT, and VAT evidence and remain flagged for review.

## Version 1.12.0 final release

### Payroll reports and worksheets (Payroll > Payroll Reports & Worksheets)
- **R10** quarterly salary tax withholding, **R5** annual employer declaration, **R6** individual annual statement.
- Any **month, quarter or year**; employees and managers in **separate sections**, plus a grand total.
- NSSF **employee 3%** and employer medical, family and end-of-service contributions.
- Rates and ceilings are **effective-dated (Date From to Date To)**: each month uses the rules in force on its own date. Saving a new Date From automatically ends the previous period the day before; overlapping periods are rejected.
- Separate columns for **retro salary (with its own retro tax)**, transport, schooling, bonus and 13th salary. R6 shows each retro period.
- Official amounts in LBP (other currencies converted at the payroll month's rate). Posted payroll only, with an optional draft preview.
- **Excel and PDF** export.

### Quarterly VAT (Quarterly VAT tab)
- **Q1-Q4** dates set automatically.
- Sales (output) VAT; deductible VAT on purchases, fixed assets, expenses and customs/imports; **non-deductible VAT** shown separately.
- VAT **payable or credit** carried forward to the next quarter (including into Q1 from the previous fiscal-year file).
- Totals **by currency with LBP equivalents**.
- **Manual adjustments** with a mandatory reason. Saving a return locks the quarter; only an administrator can reopen it.
- Marking VAT non-deductible (Uploaded Data > "VAT Deductible / Non-Deductible", or the expense checkbox) moves that VAT into cost, so the ledger always equals the return.
- **Excel and PDF** export.

### Security and polish
- New non-admin users are valid for **1 year** ("Renew 1 Year" in Security > Users). Expired users cannot sign in. Sessions end after 24 hours.
- Per-user **Payroll** and **VAT** access. At least one active administrator is always kept.
- **Legal document alerts** at sign-in and from the header button, for expired documents and documents expiring within 30 days.
- Backups use SQLite's online backup (safe while others work). Restore validates the file and creates a safety backup first.
- Clearer error messages. A page that fails to load no longer stops the others.

### Fixes
- Payroll saved from the desktop app now stores the period correctly (this previously affected payroll numbering and rate lookups).
- Exchange-rate lookups now pick the latest rate on or before the date, chronologically.
- Users created in Settings are saved to the sign-in database.

### To confirm with your accountant
The salary tax method is unchanged: transport and schooling are included in taxable salary, and one-off bonus / 13th salary are annualized ×12 in the month paid. Adjust in Tax & NSSF Settings or ask for a rule change if your practice differs.

### Build the installer (final workflow)
1. Upload the contents of this folder to the GitHub repository root (replace the old files, not the user's saved company databases).
2. Open **Actions**, select **Build Saber Accounting Installer**, click **Run workflow**. It also runs automatically on every push to `main`.
3. When it finishes, download the **SaberAccountingSetup** artifact and run `SaberAccountingSetup.exe`.

One installer only: no Python, no manual server. The data service starts automatically inside the app, and company data stays in the user's `SaberAccounting` folder across upgrades. On a new computer, the app asks you to create the initial administrator password (at least 10 characters); sign in as `admin` with that password.

## Inventory (Lebanese periodic method)
- Purchases stay in 601. Stock quantities and costs come from the stock documents.
- Costing: company-wide moving weighted average (default), allocating each warehouse's on-hand units at the current company-wide average, or FIFO by warehouse (transfers carry the oldest source warehouse cost layers). Stock can never go negative in a warehouse.
- A Sales Invoice line with an Item code issues the stock automatically (Stock Issue linked to the invoice; deleting or cancelling the invoice removes it).
- Reports: Stock Valuation (at any date, by warehouse, at cost and at sales price), Stock Card, Stock Movements, Sales Margin (COGS), Reorder, Slow-moving stock. Excel, PDF and print.
- Year end: the Stock Variation voucher (type 06) cancels account 37 against 6051 and books the closing stock (Dr 37 / Cr 6052). It is posted automatically when the year is closed, and the closing stock becomes the Opening Stock of the next year.

## Year-end order
1. Enter the last documents of the year and check the stock (Inventory > Reports > Stock Valuation at 31-12).
2. Profit & Loss > Preview Closing 6&7.
3. Close the year: stock variation, closing 6 & 7 (result to 121 / 125), and the opening of the next year (balances and stock) are made automatically.
4. "Delete Closing & Reopen Year" undoes everything if a correction is needed.

## Points to confirm with the accountant
- NSSF branch contribution percentages against the current implementing decrees (the configured 3% employee, 8% employer medical, 6% family, and 8.5% end-of-service rates are not fully primary-source verified here).
- Exact start dates of the January-April 2024 NSSF ceilings and any minimum-wage change applied partway through a month.
- VAT declaration box numbers against the official MoF form; rounding of the deduction ratio.

# Version 2.1.0

## Arabic in PDF
Every PDF (reports, statements, invoices, VAT declaration, R5 / R6 / R10, NSSF statement) prints Arabic text correctly - joined letters, right-to-left - using the Amiri font (SIL Open Font License, `assets/fonts/Amiri-OFL.txt`). Reports carry Arabic labels next to the English.

## NSSF ceilings - automatic and monthly
- A new or never-configured company loads the app's Lebanese payroll defaults for 2024-2026 (ceilings, configurable rates, family allowances, tax rounding). Settings you changed yourself are never overwritten; the "Load Lebanese Payroll Rules" action reloads them on request.
- Payroll is monthly: each payroll uses the rules in force on the **last day of its month** (for example the 90M -> 140M sickness-and-maternity ceiling change of August 2025, or the LBP 10,000 rounding from 25-11-2024 for November). Retroactive pay uses the ceilings of each of its own months.
- Payroll > Payroll Reports & Worksheets > "CEILINGS - NSSF ceilings by month" shows the ceilings and rates of every month of a year.

## NSSF payment format
Payroll > Payroll Reports & Worksheets > "NSSF - Contributions statement (payment)", monthly or quarterly, Arabic / English:
- per employee and month: NSSF number, salary subject, capped bases and contributions for sickness & maternity, family allowances and end of service using the saved rates, family allowances already paid, net due;
- payment summary by branch and the net amount payable to the NSSF (LBP);
- the monthly ceilings and rates applied; employer NSSF number from General Settings.
"Record NSSF Payment" books the payment voucher (Dr NSSF payable / Cr cash or bank).

## Payroll and NSSF compliance limits
- The current CNSS notices support the sickness-and-maternity ceiling of LBP 140M and minimum wage of LBP 28M from 1 August 2025 (Memo 801), and the family-branch ceiling of LBP 28M plus revised allowances from 1 May 2026 (Memo 831). The family ceiling of LBP 18M begins 1 July 2025 (Memo 793).
- CNSS Contribution System 11, Article 1, defines covered earnings broadly. Accordingly, the NSSF base includes transport and schooling allowances even when part of those amounts is exempt from salary tax. Supporting expense reimbursements are different and require proof.
- The consolidated Social Security Law (through 31 August 2026) delegates contribution percentages to implementing decrees. The app’s configurable 3% employee, 8% sickness-and-maternity employer, 6% family, and 8.5% end-of-service rates have not been fully verified here against the current primary decrees; verify the applicable rates before filing or paying. Existing user-saved settings are preserved, so inspect old company files for legacy rates before use.
- Foreign-worker EOS eligibility is category- and agreement-dependent; nationality alone is not sufficient. The app’s nationality/age shortcut is warning-bearing and must not be relied on without checking the employee’s CNSS category. Spouse-working family-tax deduction allocation and minimum-wage treatment for a partial month also require confirmation.
- R5, R6, and R10 exports are preparation/reconciliation worksheets, not the current MoF forms or electronic submissions. The Ministry lists R5/R6/R7 XML filing resources; this app does not generate those official submissions (including R7). NSSF statements and annual settlements are also review worksheets, not CNSS filings. The app’s automatic 10-employee monthly/quarterly period choice is only a suggestion: CNSS Law Article 72 addresses fixed contributions for small establishments, not a verified filing-frequency threshold.

## Fix
Company files created by older versions are brought up to date automatically when they are opened.

# Version 2.2.0

## Sales Invoice, Debit Note, Credit Note
- Document type: Invoice (SAL-), Debit Note (DN-), Credit Note (CN-, reverses the sale and reduces the VAT of the period).
- Lines: Item, Description, Qty, Unit, Unit Price, Total Amount, Discount %, VAT %, Net.
- Totals: Total, Discount (% or amount), **Total HT**, VAT 11% (struck through for zero-rated / exempt), TOTAL, and the **amount in words** in English and Arabic (tafqeet).
- Find by number only (type 12 for SAL-2026-000012), Duplicate, Print Preview, PDF, Print, Import Excel (template provided), Import PDF, Excel Template.

## General Journal
Find by voucher number and by details; Print Preview, PDF and Print.

## Payment & Receipt
Cash / bank accounts from 511, 512, 519 and 53 only; customers and suppliers in both tabs; **allocation** of each receipt / payment to open invoices (auto: oldest first), open balance per document.

## Purchases & Expenses
- Find instead of the lists. Purchases: items received into stock with warehouse (F2 item search; an item that does not exist is created automatically), Excel import with template, PDF.
- Cost on purchase: each cost to its own 9-digit 6018 account (601800001 freight, 601800002 insurance, 601800003 customs duties, 601800004 broker, 601800005 other); import VAT to 44210.
- Expense account chosen from accounts 626 to 69.

## Accounts
VAT: 44210 purchases, 44211 export-related purchases, 44216 expenses, 4427 sales. Payroll: 6311 salaries, 6312 bonus / 13th, 6313 commission, 6315 schooling, 6316 managers' salaries, 6319 transport, 4411 salary tax, 4431 NSSF.
Year-end result to **138** (profit) / **139** (loss); the closing voucher is "CLOSING 6&7" in the General Journal.

## Inventory
Items with cost price (average of purchases), supplier, category / subcategory, unit and location. New tabs: Categories & Units, Stock In / Stock Out (at average cost), Physical Inventory (stock on hand, count, difference, save, print, Excel sheet, upload, post the differences). Reports filter by category, subcategory, unit, supplier and warehouse together.

## F2
F2 opens the list that fits the field: items in item fields, customers / suppliers in party fields, accounts elsewhere.

# Version 2.3.0 - Statement of Account / Trial Balance
- Account From / To: search by number or name among all accounts (parents too); the account name shows beside each box (like BRAINS). "Same as From" copies the account.
- The options are in their own "Options" tab; every Show opens its own full-page tab with Print Preview, Print, Excel, PDF and Close Tab. Several statements can stay open side by side.
- Double-click a statement line to see the transaction (all its lines) and "Open in its screen" (journal voucher, sales invoice, purchase, receipt / payment, expense). In the Trial Balance, double-click an account to open its statement in a new tab.

# Version 2.4.0
- Profit & Loss > "Delete Year" (administrators): deletes the last fiscal year of a company (for example 2025, to redo the opening). A backup copy of the file is kept in `companies/<company>/deleted_years`, and the previous year is reopened with its closing removed. Type "DELETE <year>" to confirm. Then close the previous year again to make a new opening.
- NSSF statement: sickness & maternity shown as employee 3% + employer 8% = total 11% (as in the NSSF declaration).

# Version 2.5.0 - Backups per company and per year
- Backups are made automatically each day while signed in to Windows. You can also press "Create Backup Now"; safety backups are made before restore and replacement imports.
- Each company and each fiscal year has its own folder and file name: `SaberAccounting\backups\<Company>\<Year>\<Company>_<Year>_<date>_<time>.db`.
- Security / Backup / Rates > Backup & Restore shows the backups of the company and year you are in, with "Save Backup As..." (copy to a USB key or a drive folder) and "Open Backup Folder". Backups made by older versions still appear and can be restored.

# Data safety and automatic backups update

- The first standalone launch asks you to set an admin password. Existing installations keep their current password.
- Any signed-in user can create, view, and save a backup of the selected company/year from **My Backups**. Only administrators can restore a backup.
- The Windows installer installs a background backup process in the shared Startup folder. It runs after Windows sign-in, checks once per hour, and creates one backup per company/year when 24 hours have passed. The desktop window does not need to be open. The computer must be on and a Windows user must be signed in. On the first new-company launch, a backup is made immediately. Backup files live in `SaberAccounting/backups/<Company>/<Year>` under that Windows user's profile; copy this folder to another drive if you need protection from drive failure.
- Replacing imported invoices now validates the complete batch before changing the live file and keeps manual journal vouchers. If any row fails, the replacement is cancelled. A safety backup is made before a successful replacement.
- Replacement is refused when payments, stock documents, or a saved VAT return are linked to existing invoices, when a fiscal year is closed, or when existing invoices record amounts paid. Review those records first.
- Invalid company/year selections return an error. Payment and expense edits are prepared on a database snapshot before replacing the live file. Stock checks no longer temporarily remove saved movements.
- The PDF import preview scans every page and creates separate preview rows when invoice numbers change. Repeated invoice numbers on following pages are grouped. Scanned pages stay visible for manual entry. Invoices sharing one page still require manual separation and review.

# Version 2.6.0 - review of the ChatGPT changes + inventory reports
Kept from the ChatGPT changes (all tests pass): initial admin password (10+ characters) instead of admin/admin, safer invoice / payment edits (nothing lost if a save fails), year closing with automatic rollback, stricter company / year checks, local expense-account suggestions (ai_mapper) and optional OpenAI assistance (ai_service - needs an API key; it sends page 1 of the chosen invoice PDF to OpenAI).
Adjusted: the background daily backup is now an OPTIONAL installer task, unchecked by default (backups are made on request from Backup & Restore); leftover files removed (temp.txt, shortcut).

## Inventory reports
- **Inventory Summary**: key figures (items, value at cost and at sales price, potential margin, items to reorder, slow-moving and old-stock value), value by category and by warehouse, top 10 items, ageing, items to reorder.
- **Stock Ageing**: stock on hand by age of receipt (first in - first out): 0-30, 31-60, 61-90, 91-180, 181-365, over 365 days (buckets can be changed), value per bucket, average age, oldest receipt, last issue, % of old stock, category subtotals, ageing summary, and the list of stock older than 180 days to review.
- **Stock Valuation**: grouped by category with subtotals.
All with the filters (warehouse, category, subcategory, unit, supplier, costing method) and Excel / PDF / Print.

# Version 2.7.0
- Merged: the latest ChatGPT changes + version 2.6.0 (stock ageing, inventory summary, valuation by category, optional automatic backup were missing from the upload and are back).
- **Financial Reports > Business Reports** (Excel, PDF, print, preview):
  - Receivables Ageing (customers) and Payables Ageing (suppliers): open documents by days after the due date (not due, 1-30, 31-60, 61-90, 91-180, over 180 - buckets can be changed), receipts / payments not allocated, net due, % overdue, detail of open documents.
  - Item Sales by Client, and Client Quantities by Item: quantity, average price, HT, VAT, TTC.
  - Sales Analysis (3D pivot): rows (client / item / category) x columns (month / quarter / client / item / category) x measure (quantity / HT / VAT / TTC).
  - Top Clients and Top Suppliers (purchases and expenses): HT + VAT = TTC, share, cumulative share, number of documents.
  - Amounts in USD or LBP (converted at each document date) or one currency only; credit notes deducted.
- **Payroll > Tax & NSSF Settings**: the NSSF ceilings and rates by period (Date From - Date To) are edited directly in the table (double-click), with Add / Delete / Save Periods; a new Date From closes the previous period automatically.
- Lighter, calmer layout: shorter table rows (more lines on screen), soft headings, clean input borders, buttons that light up under the mouse.
