 'Basis for opinion': 'We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor\'s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants\' International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (IESBA Code), together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in Lebanon, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the IESBA Code.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\nAs part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We identify and assess the risks of material misstatement, obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit, evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates, conclude on the appropriateness of management\'s use of the going concern basis of accounting, and evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements.\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.',
